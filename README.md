Central Repository For Updated P2Pool networks.py Files

This is an attempt to consolidate a central repository for P2Pool Networks.py settings, one of the functions of p2pool is Pool Mining to help distribute mining across several locations.

Since each coin has seperate settings the need to keep these consistant is necessary to pool the hashing power across multiple locations.

Feel free to Fork and Submit Merge request, eventually this can be encorporated into a bootstrap to update this file from github when rolling new p2pool nodes.

Thanks goes out to forrestv, rav3n_pl and 0x0a for there contributions and hard work.

Please submit new coin request to be added with the proper information formated properly to be merged.
